# Tumblr Terminal Theme

*A Mac OS X Terminal Theme That Matches the Tumblr Dashboard*

I work at Tumblr and I use Terminal. One day I decided that my Terminal should match my Tumblr Dashboard, so this is the product of that.  If you love Tumblr and Terminal, [we’re hiring](http://tumblr.com/jobs).

## Install

To use the theme, download or clone the repository and double-click the Tumblr.terminal file. You can make it your default theme in Terminal.app’s Preferences.
