Tumblr Terminal Theme
===============

*A Mac OS X Terminal Theme That Matches the Tumblr Dashboard*

I work at Tumblr and I use Terminal. One day I decided that my Terminal should match my Tumblr Dashboard, so this is the product of that. 

## Install

To use the theme, download or clone the repository and double-click the Tumblr.terminal file. You can make it your default theme in Terminal.app’s Preferences.

## What it Looks Like
